Access Specifiers
--------------------
Access specifiers control the usage of
members of a class/interface across
the application.

In Java, interface members are all public.
private and protected members are not 
allowed in an interface.

Members of a class can take any one of the
four access specifiers.
1) private
2) no access specified
3) protected
4) public


private
---------
Members with private access specifier can be used within the current class only.
Such members cannot be used in
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package
 * sub classes that belong to a different package
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package 

no access specified
-------------------
Members with no access specifier can be used within
 * current class
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package
Such members cannot be used in
 * sub classes that belong to a different package
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package 

protected
-----------
Members with protected access specifier can be used within
 * current class
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package
 * sub classes that belong to a different package
Such members cannot be used in
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package 

public
---------
Members with public access specifier can be used every where without any restriction.
i.e. The member can be within
 * current class
 * sub classess of same package
 * non sub classes of same package
 * sub classes that belong to a different package
 * non sub classes that belong to a different package
