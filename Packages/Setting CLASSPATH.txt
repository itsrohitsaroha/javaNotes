Identify the parent directory of the package directory : 
Say :
 C:\Java\Packages

This location be set/concatenated in CLASSPATH

It can be done in 2 ways :

1) As a compile and execution option
javac -classpath "%CLASSPATH%;LOCATION" NameOfProgram.java
java -classpath "%CLASSPATH%;LOCATION" NameOfProgram


2) As OS level Environment Variable

Right Click on "This PC"
Select Properties
Select Advanced
Select Environment Variables
Under System Variables
Find CLASSPATH and Edit
  Name : CLASSPATH
  VALUE : <existing>;LOCATION OF  FOLDER

If CLASSPATH is not found then NEW
  Name : CLASSPATH
  VALUE : .;LOCATION OF FOLDER

FYI
-----
CLASSPATH must always have a . (dot) set in it
It represents current working directory.
