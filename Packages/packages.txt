Package
--------
A package is a collection of
 1) classes
 2) enumerations
 3) interfaces
 4) nested packages.

It defines an application (Project) or a library (API).

To make a package :
* Make a directory of the same name as of the package.

To add classes, interfaces, ... in a package :
* Define them with package statement as their first statement.
* Save them in the package directory.
(If the class, ... is public then it must be saved in a file that takes the same name as of the class, ...)

To use a package :
* Its parent directory location must be set in CLASSPATH.
* It must be imported.
* Its public classes, enumerations and interfaces can be used.

Nested Packages
-----------------
A nested package is a package inside a package.
Nested packages are used to create a meaningful hierarchy of class, interfaces,....
Example 
Case : Without nested package
  Vehicle {car, bike, scooter, truck}
Case : With nested package
  Vehicle { twoWheelers { bike, scooter} fourWheelers { car, truck} }

To create a nested package 
-------------------------
Create a sub directory (nested folder) of the same name as of the nested package.

To put classes, interfaces, ... in the nested package
---------------------------------------------
1) Define the class, interface, ... with nested package statement as its first statement.
2) Save the class, interface, ... in the nested package directory.


FYI
-----
If a java class is not put in any package then the system considers
it to be in a no-name package that spans the current directory.
