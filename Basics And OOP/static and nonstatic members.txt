A java class, generally consists data members and methods.
The data members and method can be categorized as:
* static 
* non static

non static data members
-----------------------
* Data members of a class are by default non static.
* A non static data member of the class is allocated as a member inside every object of the class.
* Its life is equal to the life of the object. 
* It is accessible through object only.


static data members
---------------------
* Data members of a class can be declared as static.
* A static data member of the class is allocated once and is not a member inside any object of the class.
* Its life is equal to the life of the class. 
* It is accessible through class reference.


non static methods
-------------------
* Methods of a class are by default non static.
* It requires an object of the respective class for invokation.
* It can directly access all other members of the class.

static methods
----------------
* Methods of a class can be declared as static.
* It doesnt require any object for invokation. Instead it is called using the class reference.
* It can directly access only the other static members of the class.
* If a static method is to access non static members of the class then it must get/create an object of the class and through the object do the access.


Note : In Java, local variables cannot be declared as static.
