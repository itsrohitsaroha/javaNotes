Java
-------
Java is an Object Oriented and 
Platform Independent programming language.


Object Oriented Programming 
------------------------------
Object Oriented Programming is a programming 
paradigm that uses concepts like
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inhertiance
* Abstraction
for application development.


Encapsulation
----------------
Encapsulation is binding the code and data of 
an entity into one unit.
The formed unit is termed as a class.


Polymorphism
----------------
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to 
perform a task in multiple ways.


Inhertiance
---------------
Inheritance is deriving sub classes from 
existing ones.
There is extension in the abilities of the 
object.

Abstraction
---------------
Abstraction is hiding the implementation details 
from the user of the object.
User of the object knows what the object does 
but is unaware of how it does.

The user of the object is unaffected by the
changes in the process of operation.

===================================

Platform Dependence
---------------------------
Programs developed using a particular language 
utilize the language API.
The language API ideally uses the OS API.
On compilation, the source and API both get 
compiled.
As the API internally use the OS API so the 
compiled binary file (executable) becomes OS 
compatible and in other words OS dependent.

Platform Independence 
---------------------------
Platform Independence is the ability of a 
software to execute on multiple systems that 
use different architectures.

Details
-----------
Oracle Corporation develops a special software 
termed as Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for every 
Operating System (OS).

JVM acts as a platform for execution of Java 
programs on the underlying OS.

JVM provides support for datatypes, libraries, 
multithreading, jre, jit compiler, etc for the 
Java applications.

A Java compiler converts all the classes of a 
java program into respective binary executable 
files termed as "bytecode".

Bytecode is inputted to a JVM, that on the fly 
compiles it and makes it OS compatible, for 
execution.

It can be said that a compiled Java program 
is JVM dependent but OS independent.
