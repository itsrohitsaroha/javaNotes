Stream
A stream is a channel of data transfer across inter connected devices.

Classification
A stream may be classified as :
 Unidirectional
 Bidirectional
Accordingly it will allow transfer of data.
Unidirectional streams may be input or output streams.
Bidirectional streams are io streams.

To utilize a stream :
1) Open it (Establish the channel). 
2) Read / Write (Data Transfer).
3) Close it (Deallocate the channel).

Standard Streams
There are 3 streams that are  auto managed for a Java application.
A program doesnt need to open orclose them, but simply needs to read/write.

The streams are :
 Input Stream
 Output Stream
 Error Stream

Input Stream
Connects the standard input device (keyboard) and the application.
A Java application utilizes the Input stream through a predefined object : System.in

Output Stream
Connects the standard output device (monitor) and the application.
A Java application utilizes the Output stream through a predefined object : System.out

Error Stream
Connects the standard output device (monitor) and the application.
A Java application utilizes the Output stream through a predefined object : System.err
